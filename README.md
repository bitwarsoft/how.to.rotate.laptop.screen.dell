It is possible to change this orientation. Hold the “Ctrl” and “Alt” keys while you press the up arrow key, and then press the down arrow key to turn the picture upside down on your phone. A left or right arrow flips the screen 90 degrees.

### Transforming into portrait

If you rotate the windows screen on your laptop / computer, it might be to keep an eye on a stranger or a suspicious co-worker. To look at the details on your screen in a long and narrow “portrait” view is often more useful than a common short and broad view. This works well with long-page websites, or tablets that display a few long columns of numbers. Having to look at a diagram or picture in the wrong direction will also make this shortcut useful. 

Use the fast keystroke to flip the entire monitor, followed by the ‘Ctrl + Alt + UP arrow‘ combination to restore it, rather than having to download and open the appropriate software.
